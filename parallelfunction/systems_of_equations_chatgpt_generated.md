Excellent — since we have your alphabet indexed from **[1][A] through [26][Z]**, we can generate **two systems of equations**, one for **f(x)** and one for **g(x)**, with each letter assigned a **unique equation** corresponding to its numeric position.

Below is a **structured layout** that keeps both functions parallel so you can later graph, cross-solve, or use them for your symbolic or sound mapping modules.

## 🔹 Optional Combined System Representation

For convenience in symbolic manipulation or visualization:

[
\begin{cases}
f_A(x) = 1x + 1, & g_A(x) = 1/x \
f_B(x) = x^2 + 2, & g_B(x) = 2x - x^2 \
\vdots & \vdots \
f_Z(x) = \ln(x^2 + 23), & g_Z(x) = 26\sin(x)\cos(x)
\end{cases}
]

Would you like me to:

1. **Solve or graph** specific subsets (e.g., A–J)?
2. **Export** the system as a JSON or CSV structure for later import into your sound-mapping or visual modules?
3. Or **build the HTML/JS drop-in** that visualizes both systems interactively (with sliders, logs, or event tracing)?
